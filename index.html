        <h2>📜 2024: A Year in Review</h2>
        <h3>🌸 Spring Semester Highlights</h3>
        <p>
          The "wisdom teeth scare" of 2024 — My teeth were hurting for months, then suddenly, the pain disappeared. They’re still in there.
        </p>

        <h3>🌞 Summer Highlights</h3>
        <p>
          Successfully repotted my plant. It’s thriving now and makes the window sill feel alive.
        </p>

        <h3>🍂 Fall Semester Highlights</h3>
        <p>
          Turned 21! Lost $100 gambling that same night. My friend immortalized the moment by writing a song about it.
        </p>

        <h3>❄️ Winter Break Highlights</h3>
        <p>
          Vegas.

        <h2>🌟 Goals for 2025</h2>
        <p>
          - Expand on 3D websites to push the boundaries of web design.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Go on a memorable hike in Oregon or Washington to connect with nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Establish a normal sleep schedule to improve overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Start packing lunches regularly to eat healthier and save money.

        <h2>🌌 Scrolling Journey</h2>

        <h3>🌀 The Torus</h3>
        <p>
          As you pass through the torus, think of spring 2024 — the uncertainties of wisdom teeth and the realization that sometimes, time is the best remedy.
        </p>

        <h3>🎲 The Cube</h3>
        <p>
          My face on a cube represents the gamble of life, like my $100 loss at 21. Every side has a story, and you learn from the rolls.
        </p>

        <h3>🌕 The Moon</h3>
        <p>
          The moon signifies reflection and ambition. Winter in Vegas reminded me that life is about the experiences we chase.
